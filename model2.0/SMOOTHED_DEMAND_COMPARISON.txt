SMOOTHED DEMAND TEST RESULTS - DEMAND VOLATILITY IMPACT ANALYSIS
====================================================================================================

TEST METHODOLOGY:
-----------------
For each SKU, identified the top 2 peak demand months (typically July 2035 and July 2034)
and replaced those peak values with the average of the remaining 118 months.

This tests the impact of demand volatility (peak spikes) on warehouse capacity requirements.

DETAILED BREAKDOWN BY SCENARIO
====================================================================================================

[1] 10/3 Business Days DoH (International: 10 days, Domestic: 3 days)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 1,514 shelves
  - Austin expansion: 5,696 shelves
  - TOTAL: 7,210 shelves

SMOOTHED DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 725 shelves
  - Austin expansion: 2,765 shelves
  - TOTAL: 3,490 shelves

REDUCTION: 3,720 shelves (51.6% less capacity needed)

[2] 5/2 Business Days DoH (International: 5 days, Domestic: 2 days)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 392 shelves
  - Austin expansion: 6,305 shelves
  - TOTAL: 6,697 shelves

SMOOTHED DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 0 shelves (no expansion needed)
  - Austin expansion: 3,151 shelves
  - TOTAL: 3,151 shelves

REDUCTION: 3,546 shelves (53.0% less capacity needed)

[3] 3/1 Business Days DoH (International: 3 days, Domestic: 1 day) - RECOMMENDED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 0 shelves (no expansion needed)
  - Austin expansion: 6,511 shelves
  - TOTAL: 6,511 shelves

SMOOTHED DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 0 shelves (no expansion needed)
  - Austin expansion: 3,131 shelves
  - TOTAL: 3,131 shelves

REDUCTION: 3,380 shelves (51.9% less capacity needed)

[4] 0/0 Business Days DoH (No safety stock - JIT inventory)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 0 shelves (no expansion needed)
  - Austin expansion: 6,507 shelves
  - TOTAL: 6,507 shelves

SMOOTHED DEMAND:
  - Sacramento expansion: 0 shelves (no expansion needed)
  - Austin expansion: 3,127 shelves
  - TOTAL: 3,127 shelves

REDUCTION: 3,380 shelves (51.9% less capacity needed)

====================================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
====================================================================================================

1. DEMAND VOLATILITY DRIVES ~52% OF CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS
   - Across all 4 DoH policies, smoothing demand reduces expansion needs by 51.6-53.0%
   - This demonstrates that peak demand spikes (primarily July 2035 and July 2034) are the
     dominant driver of warehouse capacity requirements

2. SAFETY STOCK HAS MINIMAL IMPACT (even with smoothed demand)
   - 0/0 DoH (no safety stock): 3,127 shelves
   - 3/1 DoH (recommended):     3,131 shelves
   - Difference: Only 4 shelves (0.1%)
   - This confirms safety stock is NOT the capacity driver - it's the peak demand levels

3. PEAK MONTHS IDENTIFIED
   - July 2035 was the #1 peak month for almost all SKUs
   - July 2034 was the #2 peak month for most SKUs
   - These two months alone account for ~3,380-3,720 shelves of expansion (52% of total)

4. IMPLICATIONS FOR OPERATIONS
   - Consider temporary overflow strategies for peak months (July 2034 and July 2035)
   - 3PL partnerships or temporary storage during peak seasons could eliminate 52% of CapEx
   - Peak demand management strategies (promotions, pre-orders) could smooth demand curve
   - Current model assumes permanent capacity for transient peaks

====================================================================================================
STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
====================================================================================================

OPTION A: BUILD FOR SMOOTHED DEMAND + TEMPORARY OVERFLOW
  - Build permanent capacity for smoothed demand: ~3,131 shelves (3/1 DoH)
  - Use temporary 3PL storage for 2 peak months: ~3,380 shelves capacity
  - Cost comparison:
    * Permanent: 6,511 shelves × construction cost
    * Alternative: 3,131 shelves × construction cost + temporary storage fees

OPTION B: DEMAND MANAGEMENT
  - Implement demand smoothing strategies:
    * Early-bird promotions before July peaks
    * Spread back-to-school demand across May-August
    * Pre-order programs for high-demand items
  - Goal: Reduce July peak by redistributing to adjacent months

OPTION C: HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED)
  - Build for 80th percentile demand: ~4,500-5,000 shelves
  - Temporary overflow for top 20% peak months
  - Implement modest demand smoothing initiatives
  - Balances CapEx vs OpEx tradeoffs

====================================================================================================
CONCLUSION
====================================================================================================

The smoothed demand test conclusively demonstrates that:

1. Demand volatility (peak spikes) is responsible for ~52% of warehouse capacity requirements
2. Safety stock policies have minimal impact (only 4 shelves difference between 0/0 and 3/1 DoH)
3. Two peak months (July 2035, July 2034) drive the majority of expansion needs
4. Temporary overflow strategies could reduce permanent CapEx by ~52%

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
  1. Analyze feasibility of temporary 3PL partnerships for peak months
  2. Cost-benefit analysis: permanent capacity vs temporary overflow
  3. Explore demand management strategies to smooth July peaks
  4. Consider phased expansion approach (build 3,131 now, evaluate peaks later)
