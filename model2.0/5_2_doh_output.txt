PHASE 2: PURE-SKU CONTINUOUS PACKING MODEL - 5/2 DAYS-ON-HAND
====================================================================================================

APPROACH:
  - Pure-SKU shelves: Continuous packing (volume/weight only)
  - Mixed-SKU shelves: Discrete 7-item structure
  - DoH = NO SAFETY STOCK (0 days on hand)
  - International: 0 business days | Domestic: 0 business days
  - Just-in-time inventory (only hold what's needed for monthly shipments)

[1/7] Loading data files...
   ✓ Data loaded

[2/7] Processing SKU details and dimensions...
   ✓ Processed 18 SKUs with volume/weight data

[3/7] Extracting demand data...
   ✓ Loaded demand for 120 months × 18 SKUs

[4/7] Processing days-on-hand (traditional safety stock)...

   Days-on-Hand Calculation:
   Formula: Safety Stock = (Monthly Demand / 21 working days) × DoH
   This is TRADITIONAL safety stock (days of demand coverage)

   International SKUs: 5.0 business days
   Domestic SKUs:      2.0 business days

[5/7] Loading shelf specifications for pure-SKU continuous packing...
   ✓ Shelf specifications loaded

[6/7] Generating pure-SKU packing configurations...
   Pure-SKU = entire shelf dedicated to one SKU
   - Most SKUs: Discrete item-based packing (respects max items/shelf)
   - Chairs & Desks: Continuous volume-based packing (no item limits)
   ✓ Generated 153 pure-SKU configurations
      - Discrete (items-based): 117
      - Continuous (furniture): 36
   Total configurations: 209
     - Mixed-SKU discrete: 56
     - Pure-SKU continuous: 153
   ✓ Saved to packing_configurations_pure_sku.csv

BUILDING GAMSPY MODEL WITH PURE-SKU CONTINUOUS PACKING
====================================================================================================
   ✓ Sets and parameters created
   ✓ Variables created (Columbus has no slack - must fit in current capacity)
   ✓ Constraints created (ALL facilities must be at 99%+ utilization if any expansion needed)

====================================================================================================
SOLVING MODEL
====================================================================================================

====================================================================================================
RESULTS: PURE-SKU CONTINUOUS PACKING
====================================================================================================

Total slack value: 670,083.70

[1] DEMAND FULFILLMENT
  ✓ All demand can be met!

[2] FACILITY UTILIZATION & EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS

Columbus: (HARD CONSTRAINT - no expansion allowed)
  Pallet shelves used: 3,080 / 3,080 (100.0% utilization)
  ✓ At 99%+ capacity

Sacramento:
  Pallet shelves used: 1,493 / 1,100 (135.8% utilization)
  ✓ At 99%+ capacity

Austin:
  Pallet shelves used: 7,791 / 1,484 (525.0% utilization)
  ✓ At 99%+ capacity

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sacramento:
  Pallet      : Need      393 more shelves (current:    1,100)

Austin:
  Pallet      : Need    6,307 more shelves (current:    1,484)

====================================================================================================
REDISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
====================================================================================================

Previous model (with Columbus slack allowed):
  Columbus Pallet: 4,104 more shelves needed
  Sacramento Pallet: 1,514 more shelves needed
  Austin Pallet: 251 more shelves needed

Current model (Columbus HARD CONSTRAINT - no expansion):
  Columbus: MUST fit within 3,080 pallet shelves
  Demand shifted to Sacramento and Austin (can expand)

Total new shelves needed:
  Sacramento: 393 shelves
  Austin: 6,307 shelves
  TOTAL EXPANSION: 6,701 shelves

Previous total (with Columbus expansion): 5,869 shelves
Difference: +832 shelves
