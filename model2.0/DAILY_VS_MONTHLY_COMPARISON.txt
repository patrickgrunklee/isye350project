====================================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
====================================================================================================

1. INVENTORY CARRYOVER IS THE DOMINANT FACTOR
   - Monthly models cannot properly track day-to-day inventory carryover
   - Monthly aggregation essentially treats each month as independent
   - Daily models show inventory builds up and carries forward naturally
   - Result: 75.5% to 100% reduction in capacity requirements!

2. EXISTING CAPACITY IS SUFFICIENT FOR 3/1 AND 0/0 DoH POLICIES
   - With daily inventory tracking, NO expansion is needed for these policies
   - Columbus: 3,080 pallet shelves at 100% utilization
   - Sacramento: 1,100 pallet shelves at 100% utilization
   - Austin: 1,484 pallet shelves at 100% utilization
   - Total existing capacity: 5,664 pallet shelves

3. ONLY HIGHEST DoH POLICY (10/3) REQUIRES EXPANSION
   - 10/3 DoH: 1,764 shelves needed (vs 7,210 monthly = 75.5% reduction)
   - 5/2 DoH: 392 shelves needed (vs 6,697 monthly = 94.1% reduction)
   - 3/1 DoH: 0 shelves needed (vs 6,511 monthly = 100% reduction)
   - 0/0 DoH: 0 shelves needed (vs 6,507 monthly = 100% reduction)

4. SAFETY STOCK HAS MINIMAL IMPACT (confirmed by daily model)
   - 0/0 DoH (no safety): 0 shelves
   - 3/1 DoH (recommended): 0 shelves
   - 5/2 DoH: 392 shelves
   - 10/3 DoH: 1,764 shelves
   - Only extreme safety stock policies drive capacity needs

5. MONTHLY MODELS OVER-ESTIMATED REQUIREMENTS BY 75-100%
   - The monthly aggregation approach was fundamentally flawed
   - It couldn't capture daily inventory dynamics
   - Result: Massive over-estimation of capacity needs

====================================================================================================
WHY SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE?
====================================================================================================

MONTHLY MODEL LIMITATIONS:
  - Demand aggregated at monthly level (120 time periods)
  - Inventory balance: inventory[month] >= shipments[month]
  - No carryover tracking between months
  - Each month treated as relatively independent
  - Required capacity for: peak_monthly_demand + safety_stock

DAILY MODEL CAPABILITIES:
  - Demand distributed daily (2,520 time periods = 120 months × 21 days)
  - Inventory balance: inventory[day] = inventory[day-1] + deliveries[day] - shipments[day]
  - Explicit carryover between days AND months
  - Inventory accumulates naturally over time
  - Required capacity for: working inventory + safety_stock

EXAMPLE: July 2035 Peak Month
  - Monthly model: Needs capacity for entire July demand + DoH in ONE snapshot
  - Daily model: Demand spread over 21 days, inventory replenished daily, carries forward
  - Result: Daily model needs far less peak capacity

====================================================================================================
FACILITY UTILIZATION: DAILY MODEL RESULTS
====================================================================================================

All scenarios show existing facilities at 100% utilization:

Columbus (Cannot Expand):
  - Pallet shelves: 3,080 / 3,080 (100.0%)
  - Hard constraint: Must fit within current capacity
  - Status: ✓ Operating at full capacity

Sacramento:
  - Pallet shelves: 1,100 / 1,100 (100.0%)
  - Can expand: Up to 250K sqft
  - Status: ✓ At capacity for 3/1 and 0/0 DoH
  - Expansion needed: 392-1,514 shelves for 5/2-10/3 DoH

Austin:
  - Pallet shelves: 1,484 / 1,484 (100.0%)
  - Can expand: Up to 200K sqft
  - Status: ✓ At capacity for 3/1, 5/2, and 0/0 DoH
  - Expansion needed: 251 shelves only for 10/3 DoH

====================================================================================================
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
====================================================================================================

MAJOR STRATEGIC SHIFT:
  The original analysis (monthly model) recommended 6,511 shelf expansion at Austin.
  The corrected analysis (daily model) shows NO EXPANSION is needed for 3/1 DoH policy!

REVISED RECOMMENDATIONS:

OPTION A: NO EXPANSION (3/1 or 0/0 DoH) - RECOMMENDED
  - Existing capacity is sufficient with daily inventory management
  - Cost: $0 CapEx
  - Requires: Improved inventory management systems and daily tracking
  - Risk: Operating at 100% utilization leaves no buffer
  - Suitable for: 3-day intl / 1-day domestic safety stock (or less)

OPTION B: MINIMAL EXPANSION (5/2 DoH)
  - Sacramento only: 392 pallet shelves
  - Cost: ~$784K (392 shelves × ~$2K/shelf)
  - Provides: Moderate safety stock buffer (5-day intl / 2-day domestic)
  - Benefit: 94% less CapEx than originally estimated

OPTION C: CONSERVATIVE EXPANSION (10/3 DoH)
  - Sacramento: 1,514 shelves, Austin: 251 shelves
  - Total: 1,764 shelves
  - Cost: ~$3.5M (vs $13M originally estimated)
  - Provides: High safety stock (10-day intl / 3-day domestic)
  - Benefit: 75% less CapEx than originally estimated

====================================================================================================
TECHNICAL VALIDATION
====================================================================================================

MODEL VERIFICATION:
  ✓ All daily models solved to optimality (ModelStatus.OptimalGlobal)
  ✓ Slack values: 0.00 (perfect feasibility)
  ✓ Solve times: < 3 minutes per scenario
  ✓ All constraints satisfied (99%+ utilization enforced)

INVENTORY CARRYOVER EQUATION (Daily Model):
  inventory[month, day, sku, facility] =
    inventory[month, day-1, sku, facility] +        # Yesterday's inventory
    deliveries[month, day, sku, facility] -         # Today's deliveries
    shipments[month, day, sku, facility]            # Today's shipments

  Special case for day 1 of each month:
    inventory[month, 1, sku, facility] =
      inventory[month-1, 21, sku, facility] +       # Last day of previous month
      deliveries[month, 1, sku, facility] -
      shipments[month, 1, sku, facility]

This explicit carryover tracking is what the monthly model was missing!

====================================================================================================
DATA SOURCES
====================================================================================================

All models used ORIGINAL (non-smoothed) demand data:
  - File: Model Data/Demand Details.csv
  - Periods: 120 months (January 2026 - December 2035)
  - Peak months: July 2035, July 2034 (back-to-school season)
  - Daily distribution: Uniform (monthly_demand / 21 business days)

DoH Policies Tested:
  - 10/3: Lead TIme_14_3_business_days.csv (International: 10 days, Domestic: 3 days)
  - 5/2:  Lead TIme_5_2_business_days.csv (International: 5 days, Domestic: 2 days)
  - 3/1:  Lead TIme_3_1_business_days.csv (International: 3 days, Domestic: 1 day)
  - 0/0:  Lead TIme_0_0_business_days.csv (No safety stock)

====================================================================================================
CONCLUSION
====================================================================================================

BOTTOM LINE:
  The monthly aggregation models over-estimated capacity requirements by 75-100% due to
  inability to properly track daily inventory carryover. With daily time granularity and
  proper inventory dynamics, existing facilities are SUFFICIENT for recommended 3/1 DoH policy.

KEY TAKEAWAY:
  NO WAREHOUSE EXPANSION IS NEEDED if InkCredible Supplies implements:
  1. Daily inventory tracking and management
  2. 3-day international / 1-day domestic safety stock policy
  3. Continuous replenishment with daily deliveries

COST SAVINGS:
  - Original recommendation (monthly model): 6,511 shelves ≈ $13M CapEx
  - Revised recommendation (daily model): 0 shelves = $0 CapEx
  - SAVINGS: $13 MILLION in avoided warehouse expansion!

This represents a fundamental shift in the strategic recommendation for InkCredible Supplies.
The daily model reveals that operational efficiency (inventory management) is far more
important than physical capacity expansion.

====================================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
====================================================================================================

1. VALIDATE daily model assumptions with operations team
   - Confirm daily delivery capability from suppliers
   - Verify uniform demand distribution is reasonable
   - Check feasibility of 100% facility utilization

2. IMPLEMENT daily inventory tracking system
   - Real-time inventory visibility
   - Daily replenishment planning
   - Safety stock monitoring

3. PILOT TEST 3/1 DoH policy
   - Start with one facility (e.g., Austin)
   - Monitor stockout rates and fill rates
   - Adjust as needed before full rollout

4. CONTINGENCY PLANNING
   - Consider 5/2 DoH policy as backup (only 392 shelves at Sacramento)
   - Identify temporary overflow options for extreme peaks
   - Build flexibility into long-term strategy
