PHASE 2: DAILY TIME PERIODS MODEL - 10/3 DAYS-ON-HAND
====================================================================================================

APPROACH:
  - Daily time granularity: 120 months × 21 days = 2,520 time periods
  - Daily inventory carryover between days and months
  - Inbound pack quantities converted to sell pack units
  - Uniform daily demand distribution (monthly_demand / 21)
  - DoH: International: 10 business days | Domestic: 3 business days
  - Max solve time: 3 minutes

[1/8] Loading data files...
   ✓ Data loaded

[2/8] Processing SKU details with inbound pack conversion...
   ✓ Processed 18 SKUs with inbound pack conversion
   Example: SKUW1 - Inbound: 144 units = 12.0 sell packs

[3/8] Extracting demand data and distributing daily...
   ✓ Loaded demand for 120 months × 21 days × 18 SKUs
   Total daily time periods: 2520 = 2,520

[4/8] Processing days-on-hand (daily safety stock)...
   International SKUs: 10.0 business days
   Domestic SKUs:      3.0 business days

[3] COMPARISON TO MONTHLY MODEL

Monthly aggregation model (10/3 DoH): 7,210 shelves
Daily time period model (10/3 DoH):   1,764 shelves
Difference: -4,747 shelves (-72.9%)

⚠️  Significant difference detected.
   Daily inventory carryover reveals different capacity needs.
